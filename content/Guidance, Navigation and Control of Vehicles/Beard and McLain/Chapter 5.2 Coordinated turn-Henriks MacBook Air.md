Used to find a simpler model between roll and heading/course rate 
• Can use aileron and roll to change the course over ground 
• No acceleration along the body y axis during a coordinated turn • Comfortable for passengers. • No sideslip is assumed during a coordinated turn • It is defined in Beard & McLain, but the assumptions are not described thoroughly
