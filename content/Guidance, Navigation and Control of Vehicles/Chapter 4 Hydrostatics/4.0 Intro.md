In hydrostatic terminology, the gravitational and buoyance forces are called restoring forces, and they are equivalent to the spring forces in a mass-damper-spring system.

In the derivation of the restoring forces and moments we will both look at underwater vehicles and surface vessels. 
#### 6-DOF equations of motion
$$
M\dot{\nu}+C(\nu)\nu + D(\nu)\nu + \underbrace{g(\eta)}_{1}+\underbrace{g_{0}}_{2} = \tau + \tau_{wind}+\tau_{wave}
$$
Term 1 contains the **gravitational/ buoyancy** terms
Term 2 is the **ballast control**
