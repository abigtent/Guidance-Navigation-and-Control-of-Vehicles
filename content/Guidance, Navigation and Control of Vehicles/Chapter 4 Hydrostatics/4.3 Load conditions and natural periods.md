The load condition will determine the **heave**, **roll** and **pitch** periods of a marine craft. The load condition varies over time (due to loading, offloading, fuel burning, water tanks, etc.)

$$
(M_{RB}+A(\omega))\ddot{\xi}+B(\omega)+B_{\nu}(\omega))\dot{\xi}+C\xi=\tau_{ext}
$$
This is a linear mass-damper-spring system where the seakeeping coordinates $\xi = \begin{bmatrix}\zeta_{1} & \zeta_{2}&\zeta_{3} &\zeta_{4}&\zeta_{5}&\zeta_{6}\end{bmatrix}^T$ are zero-mean wave-induced perturbations in {s} from an equilibrium state defined by a ship moving at constant heading $\psi$ and speed U. In calm water $\dot{\xi} = 0$ and {s} coincides with {b}.
The output from the hydrodynamic codes are frequency-dependent added mass A($\omega$) and potential damping B($\omega$). Viscous damping $B_{\nu}(\omega)$ is usually added using semi-empirical methods while the restoring matrix C = G.

In a linear system, the natural periods will be independent on the coordinate origin if they are computed using the 6- DOF coupled equations of motion. This is because *the eigenvalues of a linear system do not change when applying a similarity transformation.*

#### 1-DOF decoupled analysis (natural periods)
The *decoupled natural periods* should be *computed in the CF* using the decoupled equations of motion. If not, the results can be very wrong since the eigenvalues of the decoupled equations depend on the coordinate origin as opposed to the 6-DOF coupled system.

Implicit equations for frequency: Must be solved by iteration since added mass is a function of frequency.

#### Natural periods as a function of load condition

The roll and pitch periods will depend strongly on the load condition while the heave is less affected.

#### Free surface effects

Many ships are equipped liquid tanks like **ballast** and **anti-roll tanks**. A partially filled tank is known as a **slack tank** and in these tanks the liquid can move and endanger the ship stability. 
The reduction of metacentric height $GM_{T}$ caused by the liquids in slack tanks is known as the *free-surface effect*. 
The mass of the liquid or the location of the tanks play no role, only the moment of inertia of the surface affects stability. The *effective metacentric height* corrected for slack tanks filled with sea water is:

$$
GM_{T,eff}=GM_{T}-FSC
$$
$$
FSC = \sum^N_{r=1} \frac{\rho}{m}i_{r}

$$
FSC = free-surface correction
$i_{r}$ is the moment of inertia of the water surface

#### Payload effects

The metacentric height **$GM_{T}$** is reduced on board a ship if a payload with mass **$m_{p}$** is lifted up and suspended at the end of a rope of length **h**.

The effective metacentric height is:
$$
GM_{T,eff} = GM_{T}-h \frac{m_{p}}{m}
$$
where m is the mass of the vessel.

The destabilizing effect appears immediately after raising the load sufficiently to let it move freely.
